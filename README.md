# Magnetar Propeller Model with Fallback Accretion

Suite of code that models fallback accretion onto a magnetar and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo to fit this to samples of Gamma-Ray Bursts.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sgibson91/magprop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sgibson91/magprop) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sgibson91/magprop/master?urlpath=lab)

## Usage

To run the scripts in this repo, first click the badge below.
This will launch a JupyterLab environment containing the repo, via Binder.
You may wish to right-click the badge and select "Open Link in New Tab" (or whichever variant your browser provides) so you can still refer to these notes.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sgibson91/magprop/master/?urlpath=lab)

From the menu, select a Python 2 Console.
(The second icon on the second row down.)

To run a script, type the following:
```
python code/<script_name>.py
```
SHIFT-RETURN executes the command.

It is recommended that you run all the scripts from the root of the repo (i.e. do not `cd code | python <script_name>.py`).

* Figures will be saved to the sub-directory `plots/`.

### List of Scripts in `code/`

* `figure_1.py`: Reproduces figure 1
* `figure_2.py`: Reproduces figure 2
* `figure_3.py`: Reproduces figure 3
* `figure_4.py`: Reproduces figure 4
* `figure_5.py`: Reproduces figure 5
* `clean_data.py`: A script to clean the raw datafiles.
  This script **must** be run _before_ `kcorr.py` or any MCMC simulation.
* `kcorr.py`: Performs a k-correction on a GRB dataset.
  Takes command line argument `-t S` for the short GRB sample.

## Running Tests

To run tests after launching the Binder, select `terminal` from the launcher window in JupyterLab and execute the following commands.
```bash
# Activate the environment
$ source activate kernel

# Run the tests with verbose output
$ python -m pytest -vvv
```

To see the code coverage of the test suite, run the following commands.
```bash
$ coverage run -m pytest -vvv
$ coverge report
```
